## lczero-gui

Simple program to watch self-play games generate.

## To use

### Step 1:

Copy the `lczero` binary, the `client` binary into this directory.

### Step 2:

Simply install all the dependencies, and launch the application:

```
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
```

My GUI currently doesn't show good diagnostics for when it's downloading new networks, so it might take a minute or two for the pieces to start moving while it's downloading.
(TODO: Patch the client to print progress info, so my GUI can show a download bar.)

### Documentation

This code is currently horrifically undocumented.
